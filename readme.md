# Markov text generator

This repo is a chance for me to explore and practice several things:
- getting more comfortable with the Python language
- getting more comfortable with Pythonic patterns like creating and requiring modules
- try out a Python testing framework
- fodder for writing a blog about how I'm trying out a new language.
- general coding fun!
